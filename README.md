## About
A tiny entity framework written in C++. It started as a port of the ECS [Ashley](http://github.com/libgdx/ashley/)
from LibGDX but is not from the same Authors. ECS-tasy tries to be a high-performance
entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.
