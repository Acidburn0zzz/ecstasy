# ECS-tasy
[Ashley](http://github.com/libgdx/ashley/) on ~~Speed~~ C++.

Note: There is no release version yet, so check out the [develop branch](https://github.com/Lusito/ECS-tasy/tree/develop) for now.

## About
A tiny entity framework written in C++. It started as a port of the ECS [Ashley](http://github.com/libgdx/ashley/)
from LibGDX but is not from the same Authors. ECS-tasy tries to be a high-performance
entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

### Get started
