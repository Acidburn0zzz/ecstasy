[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lusito/ecstasy.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Lusito/ecstasy)

A tiny entity framework written in C++. It started as a port of the [Entity Component System](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013) [Ashley](http://github.com/libgdx/ashley/)
from LibGDX but is not from the same Authors. ecstasy tries to be a high-performance
entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

We're now running automated unit tests on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
