<div style="max-width: 800px">
<p>A tiny entity framework written in C++. It started as a port of the <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013">Entity Component System</a> <a href="http://github.com/libgdx/ashley/">Ashley</a>
from LibGDX but is not from the same Authors.
ecstasy tries to be a high-performance entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy and transparent to use.</p>

<p>We're now running automated unit tests on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This documentation is generated from the <u>development branch</u> until we have a stable API.</p>
